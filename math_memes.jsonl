{"description": "3 + 5 × 2 = 16?", "error": "Misinterpretation of multiplication and order of operations", "explanation": "The correct answer is 13. According to the order of operations (PEMDAS), multiplication is performed first: 5 × 2 = 10, then 3 + 10 = 13."}
{"description": "12 ÷ 3(3 + 3) = 18?", "error": "Misinterpretation of parentheses and division", "explanation": "The correct answer is 12. The parentheses are evaluated first: 3 + 3 = 6. Then, 12 ÷ 3 × 6 = 12."}
{"description": "5 ÷ 0 = 0", "error": "Division by zero is undefined", "explanation": "Division by zero is not allowed in mathematics. It is undefined."}
{"description": "4 × (2 + 3) = 20?", "error": "Misinterpretation of parentheses", "explanation": "The correct answer is 20, but the expression needs clarification. The parentheses should be simplified first, then multiply: 4 × (5) = 20."}
{"description": "100 - 50 ÷ 2 = 25?", "error": "Order of operations mistake (PEMDAS)", "explanation": "The correct answer is 75. Division comes before subtraction in PEMDAS: 50 ÷ 2 = 25, then 100 - 25 = 75."}
{"description": "7 - 3 × 2 = 1?", "error": "Order of operations mistake (PEMDAS)", "explanation": "The correct answer is 1. According to PEMDAS, multiplication happens before subtraction: 3 × 2 = 6, then 7 - 6 = 1."}
{"description": "5 × 3 ÷ 2 = 10?", "error": "Order of operations mistake (PEMDAS)", "explanation": "The correct answer is 7.5. In PEMDAS, multiplication and division are done from left to right: 5 × 3 = 15, then 15 ÷ 2 = 7.5."}
{"description": "√(25) = -5?", "error": "Square root mistake", "explanation": "The correct answer is 5. The square root of 25 is 5, not -5 (unless considering complex numbers, but typically the square root refers to the positive value)."}
{"description": "2 + 2 × 2 = 8?", "error": "Order of operations mistake (PEMDAS)", "explanation": "The correct answer is 6. According to PEMDAS, multiplication comes before addition: 2 × 2 = 4, then 2 + 4 = 6."}
{"description": "100 ÷ 4 × 2 = 50?", "error": "Misinterpretation of division and multiplication order", "explanation": "The correct answer is 50, but the order of operations should be clarified: 100 ÷ 4 = 25, then 25 × 2 = 50."}
{"description": "10 × 2(5 + 3) = 40?", "error": "Misinterpretation of parentheses and multiplication", "explanation": "The correct answer is 160. The parentheses are simplified first: 5 + 3 = 8, then 10 × 2 × 8 = 160."}
{"description": "1 ÷ 2 = 2?", "error": "Division mistake", "explanation": "The correct answer is 0.5. 1 ÷ 2 = 0.5, not 2."}
{"description": "3 + 2 × 5 = 25?", "error": "Order of operations mistake (PEMDAS)", "explanation": "The correct answer is 13. According to PEMDAS, multiplication comes before addition: 2 × 5 = 10, then 3 + 10 = 13."}
{"description": "10 × 5 ÷ 5 = 50?", "error": "Misinterpretation of division and multiplication order", "explanation": "The correct answer is 10. Division and multiplication are done left to right: 10 × 5 = 50, then 50 ÷ 5 = 10."}
{"description": "√(-1) = 1?", "error": "Square root of negative number mistake", "explanation": "The correct answer is i (imaginary unit). The square root of -1 is defined as 'i', an imaginary number in complex numbers."}
{"description": "3 × (4 + 2) = 18?", "error": "Misinterpretation of parentheses", "explanation": "The correct answer is 18. The parentheses should be simplified first: 4 + 2 = 6, then 3 × 6 = 18."}
{"description": "5/2 + 3 = 4?", "error": "Incorrect fraction addition", "explanation": "The correct answer is 5.5. 5 ÷ 2 = 2.5, then 2.5 + 3 = 5.5."}
{"description": "3 + 5(2 - 1) = 3?", "error": "Misinterpretation of parentheses", "explanation": "The correct answer is 8. The parentheses are simplified first: 2 - 1 = 1, then 5 × 1 = 5, and finally 3 + 5 = 8."}
{"description": "10 ÷ 2 × (2 + 3) = 15?", "error": "Misinterpretation of parentheses", "explanation": "The correct answer is 25. The parentheses are simplified first: 2 + 3 = 5, then 10 ÷ 2 × 5 = 25."}
{"description": "2 × 3 + 4 × 2 = 14?", "error": "Misinterpretation of addition and multiplication order", "explanation": "The correct answer is 16. According to PEMDAS, multiplication is performed first: 2 × 3 = 6, 4 × 2 = 8, then 6 + 8 = 16."}
{"description": "3 ÷ 2 = 2?", "error": "Division error", "explanation": "The correct answer is 1.5. 3 ÷ 2 = 1.5, not 2."}
