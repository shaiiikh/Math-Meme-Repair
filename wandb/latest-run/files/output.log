Raw Response:
 Below is a math meme with an incorrect solution. Your task is to identify the error and provide a correct explanation.

### Incorrect Meme:
A meme stating that 3 + 5 * 2 = 13

### Identified Error:


### Fixed Explanation:
**Step-by-step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Order of Operations:**
   - According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication should be done before addition.

2. **Apply the Correct Operations:**
   - First, calculate 5 * 2 = 10.

3. **Then Add 3:**
   - 3 + 10 = 13.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The correct result is 13.
   - The initial statement claiming 3 + 5 * 2 = 13 is incorrect because it ignores the proper order of operations, resulting in an addition before multiplication.

**Correct Calculation:**
3 + 5 * 2 = 13.

**Fixed Meme:**
A meme stating that 3 + 5 * 2 = 13, but this is incorrect. The correct result is 13, not 15.

---

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Operations:**
   - The expression is 3 + 5 * 2.
   - Here, we have addition (+) and multiplication (*).

2. **Apply the Correct Order of Operations:**
   - Multiplication comes before addition.
   - First, calculate 5 * 2 = 10.

3. **Perform the Addition:**
   - Now, add 3 to the result: 3 + 10 = 13.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The correct value of the expression is 13.
   - The initial claim that it equals 15 is wrong because it incorrectly adds first before multiplying.

**Correct Meme:**
A meme stating that 3 + 5 * 2 equals 13, which is correct. The incorrect version claiming it equals 15 is an error due to not following the order of operations.
</think>

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Order of Operations:**
   - According to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), multiplication is performed before addition.

2. **Apply the Correct Operations:**
   - First, calculate \(5 \times 2 = 10\).

3. **Then Add 3:**
   - \(3 + 10 = 13\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The correct result is 13.
